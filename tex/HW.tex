\section{Abstract}
Does network structure determine which agents will attend the bar in a modified El Farol Bar problem.  In most cases, the network does not appear to converge to a single stable fixed point, but rather oscillates around an attractor in which some agents always attend and others attend in alternating weeks.  

\section{Introduction}

The El Farol Bar problem, named and popularized by Brian Arthur, is a stylized model in which agents attempt to utilize a limited resource while avoiding congestion \cite{arthur:1994}.  The name of the problem is inspired by a bar called El Farol in Santa Fe, which had a popular weekly event with live music.  Everyone enjoys the evening if the space is not overcrowded, but if too many people attend, everyone will have a worse time than if they had stayed home.  The El Farol bar problem differs from classical economic analyses of the tragedy of the commons by allowing agents to select their strategies inductively based on past performance over a period of time.

In Arthur's original publication, each agent has access to a finite pool of fixed strategies, as well as weekly attendance history for the entire system.  At each timestep, the agent selects the strategy that would have led to the best performance over some recent time window.  In the original setup and many later variants, weekly attendance will never completely stabilize but will oscillate around the congestion threshold \cite{arthur:1994} \cite{chen:2012} \cite{zambrano:2004}.  While attendance is attracted to a certain range, the distribution of strategies amongst agents does not stabilize.  However, in simpler setups in which agents choose from just two or three strategies, the system will converge to a stable and predictable attractor depending on the initial strategy distribution \cite{stLuce:2020}.

Scholars have motivated the importance of this problem with applications such as traffic and public transit congestion, internet traffic, and financial markets \cite{zambrano:2004} \cite{chen:2012}.  In these applications, modeling agents as behaving independently and attempting to optimize solely their own utility may be a reasonable model for empirical behaviors.  However, humans are social animals and in many situations, including the original story motivating the El Farol bar problem, agents may not only prefer to avoid crowding, but also prefer the company of friends.  Thus agents must balance two competing priorities, the need to coordinate with other members of a local neighborhood within a social network, and the need to avoid crowds.

There are variants of the El Farol problem that use coordination between agents to allow agents a broader choice of optimal strategies, although in such cases group coordination leads to lower overall utility as groups sharing the same strategy drive overcrowding. \cite{collins:2017} \cite{wilensky:2015}.  In addition, a variant of the problem has agents in a social network where agents' choices to go to the bar depend on their neighbors' history.   When these simulations are run on very regular network structures, a range of diverse equilibria can occur \cite{chen:2012}.  However, the agents have no innate preference to attend with or without their neighbors.

To model agents with a preference to attend the bar together, we construct a model in which each agent chooses whether to attend at time $t = 1$ based on their neighbor's behaviors at time $t$.  The strategy that can be varied then is the threshold value for attendance.  Without adaptive learning, this model resembles the threshold model for binary opions, which has been rediscovered and published in different contexts by economist Thomas Schelling \cite{schelling:1978} and sociologist Mark Granovetter \cite{granovetter:1978} \cite{grabish:2020}.  

If agents' thresholds are sufficiently low relative to their degrees on a fixed network, then the action, in this case attending the bar, would spread over the entire network, leading to congestion.  However, if the thresholds are too high, no agent will ever attend.  Between these two extremes, threshold models may have many stable or semi-stable fixed points \cite{adam:2012} and hysteresis \cite{Wiedermann_2020}.  Threshold models may also have limit cycles.  On an undirected network, these can be shown to always have period 2 \cite{grabish:2020} \cite{goles:1980}.

In the context of the El Farol bar problem, this paper will explore the impact of network structure on the dynamics of this intermediate regime.  When will network structure lead to suitably varied limiting behavior such that the bar can maintain attendance by a group of regulars without becoming overcrowded?  

We consider the impact of mean degree, heterogeneity of degree, and community structure on the number of agents attending, the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions, and the frequency of period 2 limit cycles.  We also consider the impact of random noise and examine the stability of fixed points on a particularly regular network.

\section{Model Specification}
To test the hypothesis that local differences in the structure of social networks can encode the diversity of strategies required to regulate attendance, we construct a simple scenario in which each agent chooses to attend the bar if at least $\ell$ of the agent's neighbors attended the previous week.  We define the attendance vector $\vec{y}(t)$ such that
\begin{equation}
  y_i(t) = \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{if agent}\; i \; \text{attends on week t} \\
    0 &\text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Then 
\begin{equation}
  \vec{y}(t + 1) = F(\mathbf{A}\vec{y}(t))
\end{equation}

where
\begin{equation}
  F(\vec{x})_i = \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{if} \; x_i > \ell \\
    0 &\text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

A traditional implementation of the El Farol bar problem would require some mechanism for modulating attendance patterns depending on the congestion level at the bar.  However, this paper will focus on the regulatory effect of the network structure itself.  As we shall see, in many cases the interaction of network structure with an appropriate choice of $\ell$ will maintain attendance below the traditional 60\% threshold. 

\section{Fixed Points}

Fixed points of this system occur where

\begin{equation}
  \vec{y}_{\infty} = F(\mathbf{A}\vec{y}_{\infty})
\end{equation}

Unsurpisingly, the trivial fixed point of $\vec{y}_{\infty} = \vec{0}$ is a solution since $\mathbf{A}\vec{0} = \vec{0}$ and $F(\vec{0}) = \vec{0}$.  There may also be nontrivial fixed points, depending on the network and $\ell$.  Let $S$ denote a subset of nodes such that every element of $S$ has at least $\ell$ neighbors in $S$ and no element of $S^C$ has $\ell$ neighbors in $S$.  If we construct $\vec{y}$ such that  
\begin{equation}
  y_i = \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{if} \; i \in S \\
    0 &\text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
 then for all $i \in S$, $\mathbf{A}\vec{y} > \ell$ and for all $y \notin S$, $\mathbf{A}\vec{y} \leq \ell$.  Thus $\vec{y} = \mathbf{A}y$. 

In general, we cannot expect $S$ to be unique.  As a simple example, suppose the network contains two mutually exclusive $\ell$-cliques, each of which is connected to the rest of the network by less than $\ell$ edges.  Then the network must have at least 3 nontrivial fixed points, consisting of the vertices in one or both cliques.

Algorithm 1, finds a fixed point of an arbitrary graph $G=(V,E)$.  We show that it will return the maximally large fixed point (MFP) possible, and that the MFP is unique for any $G$.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Find MFP}\label{alg:two}
  \KwData{$G = (V, E)$, $\ell$}
  $G'(V', E') \gets G(V, E)$;
  $N \gets 0$;
  \While{$V'.size \neq N$}{
    $N \gets $ V'.size\;
    Delete all vertices with degree $\leq \ell$ \\
    Remove all dangling edges
  }
  \Return{V'}
  \end{algorithm}

  The termination condition of the while loop guarantees that every element of $V'$ has at least $\ell + 1$ neighbors in $V'$.  Therefore, $V'$ must be a fixed point of $G$ with respect to $\ell$.  
  
  To show that $V'$ is the unique MFP, we introduce the following invariant that must be true at every iteration of the while loop: any $v \in V$ such that $v \notin V'$ cannot be in a fixed point of $G$ with respect to $\ell$.

  On initialization, all elements of $V$ are in $V'$ so the invariant is trivially true.  During execution, the loop invariant guarantees that all possible elements of a fixed point are in $V'$, so any elements that are deleted cannot have $\ell + 1$ neighbors in the fixed point.  Therefore they cannot be in the fixed point themselves.  On exit, no additional nodes are deleted from $V'$.  So any node $v \notin V'$ cannot be a part of a fixed point and $V'$ contains the maximum possible set of nodes whose attendance could be a fixed point with respect to $\ell$. 

\section{Deterministic Simulations}
We can use numerical simulations to gain a stronger understanding of the steady state behavior of the system (if applicable).  We use three different well-understood random graph models: the Erdos-Renyi random graph, in which all possible edges exist with equal probability, the Chung-Lu model, which weights edge probabilitiies to obtain a target degree distribution, and the stochastic block model (SBM), in which the probabiliity of an edge is depends on its membership in a particular block.  Comparing the results on the Erdos-Renyi network vs. the Chung-Lu model, generated with a power law degree distribution, allows us to evaluate the impact of a heterogeneous degree distribution on the steady state of the system, while the SBM allows us to explore the impact of community structure.  The simulations were designed so that that the number of nodes and edges would be similar between the three models.

\begin{figure}[h!]

  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{sbm_attendance.png}
  \caption{Weekly attendance pattern on fixed random networks across multiple trials}
\end{figure}

Figure 1 shows weekly attendance numbers on these random graphs over repeated trials with varying initial conditions.  Attendance converges to a consistent count in most but not all trials.  However, even on the same network with the same number of agents attending at $t=0$, weekly attendance varies between trials.  In both the Erdos-Renyi and SBM simulations, some initial conditions (wiith 30\% of agents attending) led to no agents attending at steady state, while others led to attainment of the maximal fixed point.  In addition, there were intermediate states in which a fraction of the MFP attended while other members of the MFP never attended.  These intermediate states were much more frequent on the SBM versus the Erdos-Renyi model. 

In contrast, the Chung-Lu model leads to much more stable results.  However, results are still not identical between trials, and no trial attained the MFP.  To further test the relationship between heterogeneous degree distribution and variations in steady state attendance, figure 2 plots the standard deviation of the degree distribution against the standard deviation of steady state attendance between multiple trials on fixed networks.  Mean degree was held steady between trials.  This experiment validates the observation that more varied degree sequences lead to more stable attendance patterns, although the plot also highlights the role of randomness in determining whether a network will have multiple reachable steady states.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{chung_lu_std.png}
  \caption{Standard deviation of degree distribution vs. steady state attendance patterns on the Chung-Lu model}
\end{figure}

In many simulations, the exact same group of agents attended every week, resulting in a true fixed point as described in Section 3.  However, all three experiments had some trials in which the composition of agents attending varied from week to week.  After discarding the first 50 timesteps of the simulation, some agents attended every timestep, some agents never attended, and, in many trials, some agents attended exactly half of the timesteps.

Further investigation revealed that agents attending alternate weeks were coupled to each other.  If a pair of agents each have exactly $\ell$ neighbors attending, excluding each other, each agent will attend at time $t+1$ if and only if the other attended at time $t$.  If one agent but not the other attends as part of the initial conditions, the two agents will toggle back and forth indefinitely, caught in a game of telephone tag in which they miss running into each other at every timestep.  In some cases, more complex interactions occur, involving more than two agents.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{always_sometimes_never.png}
\caption{Fraction of agents observed attending always, sometimes, or never in at least one trial.}
\end{figure}

Figure 3 shows the number of distinct agents attending always, sometimes, or never in at least one trial for each of the three random graph models.  The figure shows the contrast between the Chung-Lu model with a heavy-tailed degree distribution, which has around half of the nodes in the Always and Never camp, and very few in Sometimes, compared with the Erdos-Renyi and stochastic block models, which have a much more variabiliity.  Almost all agents are occasionally in both the Always and Never groups depending on the trial, and many more agents attend sometimes.  These results suggest that more homogeneous degree distributions increase the probability of agents engaging in telephone tag behaviors, as well as variability in steady state attendance.

\section{Analysis of Stability on a Lattice}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{one_minus.png}
\caption{Unstability of universal attendance on the Von Neumann neighborhood network.}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{alt_minus.png}
\caption{Unstability from below of universal telephone on the Von Neumann neighborhood network.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{alt_plus.png}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{zero_plus.png}
\caption{Stability from above of universal nonattendance and universal telephone tag}
\end{figure}


To understand the relationship between telephone tag and degree distribution, we consider a much more structured network.  Consider a network with nodes are arranged in a grid of shape $N$ by $N$ for some even integer $N$.  Each node is connected to the other nodes in its Von Neumann neighborhood, defined as the cells to the left, right, above or below where they exist.  Cells on the edges of the grid are have edges wrapping around to connect to the other side, so every node has exactly four neighbors.  If the simulation is run on this network, with $\ell = 3$, meaning a minimum of 4 neighbors are required, both universal attendance and universal nonattendance will be fixed points.  Universal telephone tag, in which every agend attends in alternate weeks, offset from all four neighbors, will also sustain itself indefinitely barring any perturbations.

The system can sustain either universal attendance or universal telephone tag, but has no redundant edges above the minimum required.  If a single agent in the universal attendance scenario fails to attend at one timestep, as shown in figure 3, its neighbors will not attend at the next one, and a telephone tag scenario will emerge, beginning at the epicenter of the disruption and spreading across the entire network until there is universal telephone tag.  In the universal telephone tag scenario, as soon as one node fails to attend, non-attendance will spread and engulf the entire network.

However, if an agent attends an extra time in either the universal telephone tag or universal nonattendance scenarios, the effect cannot spread and the system returns to equilibrium as shown in figures meh and morp.

On these networks and other $\ell + 1$-regular graphs, universal nonattendance is the only stable fixed point.  The fact that attendance can stabilize to a nonzero level in simulations on random networks is only possible because some nodes have degree greater than $\ell + 1$.

\section{Random Noise}
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{noisy_erdos_renyi_mean.png}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{mean_degree_v_noise.png}
  \caption{Behavior with noise on an Erdos-Renyi random graph, $\ell + 1 = 4$, varying $\epsilon$, $\langle k \rangle = 9.69$ (Top), and varying $\langle k \rangle$, $\epsilon = 0.15$ (Bottom)}
\end{figure}

In deterministic simulations on both regular and random networks, telephone tag phenomena are common and the MFP is often unreachable.  When each node has degree exactly $\ell + 1$, we have seen that the presence of randomness drives attendance down.  However, with sufficient density of edges, noise could allow otherwise unreachable nodes in the MFP to begin attending.

To test the impact of noise on random networks, we introduce a new parameter, $\epsilon$ to govern the noisiness of the system.  We define

\begin{equation}
  F'(\vec{x})_i = \begin{cases}
    1 - F(x_i) &\text{with} \\
    & \text{probabiliity} \epsilon \\
    F(x_i) &\text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

and set
\begin{equation}
  \vec{y}(t + 1) = F'(\mathbf{A}\vec{y}(t))
\end{equation}

We find an interesting relationship between $\langle k \rangle$ and $\epsilon$.  When $\langle k \rangle$ is sufficiently large, figure 7 (top) shows that increasing $\epsilon$ increases attendance until the network is reliably close to the MFP.  However, figure 7 (bottom) shows that this effect only occurs after a phase transition occuring around $\langle k \rangle = 2 (\ell + 1)$.

\section{Discussion}

The El Farol Bar problem has traditionally considered a population of agents with diverse strategies attempting to share a limited resource.  Traditional strategies often result in some agents attending always, some attending never, and some attending periodically, with a total attendance close to the tolerance threshold\cite{arthur:1994} \cite{stLuce:2020}.

In this paper, we find that a population of agents all following the same network-based strategy can behave similarly to the system of agents with heterogeneous strategies, with a subset of agents always attending, a subset never attending, and a subset attending periodically.  Furthermore, we have see how the interaction of the threshold, network structure, and random noise can effect the strategy distribution, with higher mean degrees, and, in some regimes increased noise leading to higher rates of attendance, and heterogeneous degree distributions leading to decreased sensitivity to initial conditions and lower rates of telephone tag behaviors.

A network can encode a distribution of strategies across multiple agents, but a natural extension of this work would be to reintroduce the evolutionary or inductive learning component that characterizes previous work on the El Farol bar problem.  One way to do this would be to allow agents to vary their $\ell$ value based on past performance.  Another possibility would be to allow agents to modify the network structure, such as forming new edges if they do not have sufficient friends in attendance, or removing edges if they are encountering congestion.  It could also be interesting to examine the results of these processes on empirical social network datasets, which tend to be much less locally treelike than the random graph models examined.
